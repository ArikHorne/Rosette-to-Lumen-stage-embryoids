# Rosette-to-Lumen-stage-embryoids
In this study Langkabel and Horne et al. present an embryo-like organoid cell culture model termed RtL-embryoids,
that can be generated from a solely embryonic stem cell-based starting cell population using cellular reprogramming paradigms. 
The authors demonstrate that induction of trophoblast- or endoderm- stem cell lineage-specific transgenes in two of the starting embryonic stem cell lines,
in 3D co-culture with a third embryonic stem cell line, that remains in a state of pluripotency leads to self-organization into tissues resembling epiblast,
extraembryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm. This study provides a detailed analysis of the interaction between the three tissues comprising RtL-embryoids
and their developmental progression, which was demonstrated to recapitulate specific developmental hallmarks of early mouse embryogenesis. 
The comparison to murine embryos at different development stages by single-cell RNA-Seq analysis reveals the highest similarity to embryos between E4.5 – E5.5,
which was confirmed morphologically, as RtL-embryoids are demonstrated to undergo formation of rosettes and subsequent lumenogenesis in epiblast- and extraembryonic
ectoderm-like tissues, accompanied by a progression of pluripotency states in cells comprising the epiblast-like compartment.
